# Competitive Nighttime Stomatal Conductance
by Karrin E. Tennant (https://github.com/karrint)

### Project description
This is the repository housing my undergraduate research project scripts. The project evaluates how cottonwood trees use water in the presence or absence of competition. Measurements of nighttime stomatal conductance (gsn) were recorded for cottonwoods in varying degrees of competition over the course of an 8-week drought period.

### How to use and install
Stay tuned.
