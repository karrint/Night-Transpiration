## `transformed_data`
This directory houses all processed data sets that are associated with the night transpiration project. 


hegyi.xlsx calculates hegyi indices of competitive tree pairs using this equation: 
(Db/Da)/DISTab
Db = Diameter of competitor
Da= Diameter of focal tree
DISTab = Distance between competing trees


Transpiration.xlsx conatains transpiration rates (mol m⁻² s⁻¹), stomatal conductance rates (mol m⁻² s⁻¹), and percent soil moisture for each tree at each sampling time.
